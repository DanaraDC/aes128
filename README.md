# aes128
This repository provides a Python implementation of AES-128, a secure and efficient symmetric encryption algorithm. It includes encryption and decryption processes with SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, AddRoundKey transformations, and iterative 10-round transformations, along with key expansion using AES key scheduling.
